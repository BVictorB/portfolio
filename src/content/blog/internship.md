title: How to find an internship
order: 1
---

I recently started looking for a graduation internship myself, and noticed that there is quite a lot to consider when looking for an internship. So I decided to create this guide to finding an internship where I share my experiences.  
&nbsp;  
## What kind of internship?
It it good to start thinking about the kind of company where you would like to do your internship, there are a lot of different companies that do a lot of different work. Would you like to work with a big or a small company? Would you like to work on many smaller projects or a single in-house project? I decided to look for a bigger company because I feel that the internship process is a bit more streamlined, simply because they have probably had a lot more interns and iterated on the internship process. This is ofcourse not the case for every company, but I decided to try this out. I did my short internship at a smaller company and really enjoyed my time there, but it felt like there could have been a bit more structure looking back at it now. This is what I expect during my upcoming internship at the (a lot) bigger company.  
During the process of applying and getting interviews with companies I would also recommend thinking about the type of people that you encounter. Are you being respected and taken seriously? Are these the kind of people that you would like to work with and for? I personally only encountered people that I would love to work with during my search for my internship. But I have heard quite a bit of other stories from other students.

## How to prepare before applying
Before I started applying for internships I decided to create a portfolio website where I can display all my work. You could also just send a link to your GitHub profile, but creating a personal portfolio website gives you the freedom to showcase all your projects just the way how you like it. It also shows that you take yourself and your work seriously since you take the time and effort to display it properly. This does not have to be overly complicated, but it is a nice addition when you apply for an internship position at a company.  
When you want to apply for internships you should write a motivation letter that is tailored for the company that you are applying to. Take your time to convince the recruiter that you would be a suitable intern. You do not want to copy and paste the same motivation letter over an over again, make it personal.

## How to prepare for your first interview
Once you have applied for internships, you will probably get invited for an interview. An interview is a great way to get to know each other, for you to see if you would like to do your internship here and for the company to see if you are qualified for the internship. I have done quite a bit of interviews during my search for an internship, and I really enjoyed doing them. All of them were very nice, it was interesting to learn more about the companies and fun to tell about my enthusiasm in the field of frontend.  
Before you have your interview you should write down some questions you would like to ask to the company. There is probably a lot that you would like to know before you decide to have your internship with that company. I made the mistake to not do this before my first interview, a lot of questions that I would have liked to asked popped into my head after I already finished the interview. It would have been better to be able to ask these questions during the interview itself instead of after it.  
It is also good to think about what you would answer to questions that get asked frequently during interviews, like 'What attracted you to our company?' or questions about your strengths and weaknesses.

## After finding your internship
**Congratulations!** You have found the perfect internship! There are a few things that you might need to do now, if you were still in contact companies that have offered you an internship position or if you have interviews planned. Now is the time to let them know that you have decided to go with another company. Most companies will be very understanding because they know you are not just applying to a single company. It can be very beneficial for you to stay on good terms with the company, since you never know what might happen in the future. And ofcourse they have invested time in doing interviews and whatnot with you, that is something that I was personally very grateful for.
