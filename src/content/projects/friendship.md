This project was created in a team with two other students for the final assignment of the Blok-tech course. The goal was to produce a fully working full-stack web-application where people can sign up, log in and match with each other. I was mainly focussing on the code, while the other students did the design. The sign up system is quite cool in my opinion, I added great client-side validation with RegEx, server-side validation with a Mongoose Schema (also with RegEx), password hashing with bcrypt and email address verification with Nodemailer. You can also upload profile pictures, we have implemented this using the Multer dependency.

This was the first project for me where I had to work with NodeJS (and every dependency that we have used in this project), and also the first time that I worked with a database. It was a very learning experience, with a great result.
