This web application was created for the Progressive Web Apps course during the Web Design and Development minor. During this course we had to create a (as the name indicates) progressive web application. We also had to focus on the performance of our apps. I have created 'Stonks', a web application where you can get all the info that you need about stocks. You can search for a stock and get the live price, daily quote, news and a push notification when the price drops below your set price. You can also add these stocks to your favorites, these favorites get saved into your cookies. When you visit the favorites page you get a list with all your favorite stocks, with a bit of information and the daily news of that stock.  
&nbsp;  
Since this is a progressive web app, you can install it. It also caches some pages so they are available offline. But since this web application uses a lot of data that has the importance of being up to date, it won't be fully functional without a connection to the server.
