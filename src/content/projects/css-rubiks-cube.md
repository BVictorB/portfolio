The goal of this course (CSS to the Rescue) was to built something with just HTML and CSS (so no JavaScript unless you really needed it). The problem was: I just really like JavaScript. So I wanted to create this Rubik's Cube really fast so I could start making it actually work with JavaScript. But since this course is so focussed on CSS, I decided to really get to know more about 3D transforms and calculations/functions in CSS. I've never even worked with calculations or variables in vanilla CSS (I did do some of this with SCSS). When I finished this project I was glad that I decided to stick to CSS, since I have learned a lot of new stuff about CSS.

The Rubik's Cube can still animate, if you open the live version in a browser window and start resizing it. I obviously did this with media queries, this was a quick and easy way to still make the Rubik's cube 'work'. I might go back to this project in the future to actually add the JavaScript that I wanted to make it fully interactive.
