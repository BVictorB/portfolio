This project was created in a team with two other students during the 'Dataweek' project for the Information Design theme semester. I wrote all the code myself, while the others were busy with the storytelling of the project, the UX/UI, creating all the visual assets and creating animations for me in Adobe After Effects, so I could recreate them with CSS. We have created this whole project in just two days, I was busy with the code for about one day and a half. We only had a week to come up with a corona-related concept, collecting the data and creating the project. We are very satisfied with the result.  
&nbsp;  
For the data we went to the ferries at the Central Station in Amsterdam, we stayed there for about two hours counting everybody that was coming off the ferry. We were counting everybody that was wearing a facemask or not, we also wrote down what type of passenger they were (pedestrian, cyclist or moped driver). We noticed that a lot of people take off their mask before leaving the ferry, but the moment you leave the ferry, you are the closest to other people.

Most of the illustrations are made in Adobe Illustrator, then exported as SVG, and then implemented/animated in the code. All the interaction is of course done with code. The whole project is built in React.
