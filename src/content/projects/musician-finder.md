A friend of mine and me wanted to work on a project together for a while, after some time this concept came up in my head. I started doing some research and quickly found out that there are not that many options regarding a matching-like app for musicians and people in the music industry in general. We think that we can create a product that could help many people in the music industry with finding other musicians to create awesome music or events together.  
&nbsp;  
While creating this application, my friend will mainly focus on the backend code, and I will focus on the frontend. He finished his software engineering study in 2020, so he has quite some experience with projects like this. For the technologies of this project we chose to work with React Native for creating the application, since I already did a lot of work with JavaScript, this would be the most efficient way to develop this application for us. We also use Redux for state management, and work with TypeScript to increase the productivity while developing. The backend will be built with Kotlin.  
&nbsp;  
Before we started developing we did quite a bit of research, we created a plan and wrote down all the features that we wanted to add to the app. We have now started developing, and are working on a fully functional prototype so we can start testing the app with people that are in this industry. We want to test the app with people that are creating music, like band members, solo artists and producers. But also with people that work in the event industry and music labels, since this could be a good product for them aswell.

**All the code is currently in a private repository, but it would be possible to share the code on request.**
