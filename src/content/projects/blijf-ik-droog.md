title: Blijf ik droog?
description: A web-application that lets you know how late you should leave to avoid the rain. The usage is really simple but powerful. You just have to type in your location (or use GPS) and the amount of minutes that your journey will take.

As the name of this course implies, this course is about building a web app from scratch. The name of this project is 'Blijf ik droog?' ('Will i stay dry?'), I wanted to create a very simple web application that calculates if you stay dry when walking/cycling from your current location. This is something that I would use myself since I always check the Buienradar.nl graph to check if I will get home/to my desired location dry. The thing is that this takes effort since you have to look at a graph and calculate the timing yourself. This project gives you the time of departure itself so you don't have to worry about the rain. It makes a very simple task easy as pie.
