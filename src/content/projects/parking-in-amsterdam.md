This is the last course of the three courses (functional programming, frontend data and frontend applications) for this project. In this course we started working with frontend frameworks (in my case React). I continued working on the data visualization but made everything work properly with states and everything in React. Working with React was new for me, but it did not take long to understand it. It made me very productive, and it was a lot easier to achieve the same results as before, but with less code.  
&nbsp;  
My idea for this project was to retrieve data from the RDW datasets and from the datasets of the city of Amsterdam to make an interactive map. I wanted to plot out different parking areas on the map, with the different prices that are being used. If I could get the data of the history of these parking prices, I want to be able to scroll through time and see how the prices have changed. I also wanted to plot all the parking garages in Amsterdam on the map, and see when they opened and compare this to the changes in parking prices. And if I have the data for it, I would also like to compare the prices of the parking garages to the prices of parking on the street (also going back in history).

Data Amsterdam did not have the data that I needed to accomplish the concept I had in mind. So I created a map where you can compare parking garages with each other and with parking areas in Amsterdam.
