This project was created for Lobke Meekes (the creator of 'Eenwoud'). Eenwoud is a concept where people can register trees so they get re-planted in a big forest with trees that have a special story. We had to create an interactive web-application that displays all the trees, we had to visualize the data that was available to us.

I have used the awesome React framework for this project. I decided to use React since I already had some experience with it, and because it was nice to use for the state management of the app. Most components are split up into the 'components' folder, and I placed the three main screens (intro, map and register) in the 'screens' folder. For styling I used SCSS (since this makes me a lot more productive) and for the naming/classing of elements I used the BEM method (Block, Element, Module). For the map with the trees plotted onto it I have used D3.js. This is a great library for visualizing data.
